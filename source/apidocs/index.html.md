# Introduction

Welcome to the Back4App API Documentation for {{app.appName}}. These APIs provide an easy way to use the backend features generated by [Back4App](https://www.back4app.com/) platform for your app. The APIs are mostly generated through [Parse Server](https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/) and follow the best practices for development of RESTful APIs. The API documentation is automatically generated by Back4App platform and is specific for your app {{app.appName}}. Any changes that you do in your app's backend schema through [Parse Server Dashboard](https://parse-dashboard.back4app.com/apps/{{app.id}}/), [Back4App CLI](https://www.back4app.com/docs/platform/command-line-tool/parse-server-setup/) or even these APIs are reflected here.

<aside class="notice">
This documentation is not yet exhaustive and our team is still working to make it complete. Meanwhile, please check the <a href="#learning-more">Learning more</a> section to learn about the APIs not yet documented here.

# Getting Started

Since these are RESTful APIs, you are free to use your preferred technology to perform HTTP requests according to this documentation. Although we highly encourage you to use them through one of the [Parse SDKs](https://docs.parseplatform.org/) for a faster and better development experience. Please find below how to install each of the supported SDKs.

## Installing Parse SDK

<blockquote class="lang-specific shell"><p>
There is not a specific Parse SDK for cURL and you just need to make sure that cURL is installed in your machine. Most of the Operational Systems bring cURL installed by default, but you can also download the latest version of it in <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/download.html">cURL Official Web-Site</a>.
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="lang-specific javascript"><p>
Install <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/parse">Parse JavaScript SDK npm module</a>:
</p></blockquote>

```javascript
npm install parse
```
<blockquote class="lang-specific javascript"><p>
You do not need to install nor initialize JavaScript SDK when creating Cloud Code Functions since it is installed and initialized by default.
</p></blockquote>

Please choose below one of the [Parse SDKs](https://docs.parseplatform.org/) and learn how to install it using the instructions that you can find in the right panel of this documentation.

[Installing JavaScript SDK](?javascript#installing-parse-sdk)


## Initializing Parse SDK

<blockquote class="lang-specific shell"><p>
You do not need to do any kind of initialization when using cURL but you must send your app's credentials in the headers of all requests that you'll do. Example:
</p></blockquote>

```shell
curl -X GET \
-H "X-Parse-Application-Id: {{app.appId}}" \
-H "X-Parse-REST-API-Key: {{app.restKey}}" \
{{app.apiURL}}/serverInfo
```

<blockquote class="lang-specific javascript"><p>
In a Node.js project:
</p></blockquote>

```javascript
const Parse = require('parse/node');

Parse.serverURL = '{{app.apiURL}}'; // This is your Server URL
Parse.initialize(
  '{{app.appId}}', // This is your Application ID
  '{{app.javascriptKey}}', // This is your Javascript key
  '{{app.masterKey}}' // This is your Master key (never use it in the frontend)
);
```

<blockquote class="lang-specific javascript"><p>
In an Ionic project:
</p></blockquote>

```javascript
const Parse = require('parse');

Parse.serverURL = '{{app.apiURL}}'; // This is your Server URL
Parse.initialize(
  '{{app.appId}}', // This is your Application ID
  '{{app.javascriptKey}}' // This is your Javascript key
);
```

<blockquote class="lang-specific javascript"><p>
In a React Native project:
</p></blockquote>

```javascript
const { AsyncStorage } = require('react-native');
const Parse = require('parse/react-native');

Parse.setAsyncStorage(AsyncStorage);
Parse.serverURL = '{{app.apiURL}}'; // This is your Server URL
Parse.initialize(
  '{{app.appId}}', // This is your Application ID
  '{{app.javascriptKey}}' // This is your Javascript key
);
```

<blockquote class="lang-specific javascript"><p>
In a Web Browser (React, Angular, Vue, etc) project:
</p></blockquote>

```javascript
<script src="node_modules/parse/dist/parse.min.js"></script>

<script>
Parse.serverURL = '{{app.apiURL}}'; // This is your Server URL
Parse.initialize(
  '{{app.appId}}', // This is your Application ID
  '{{app.javascriptKey}}' // This is your Javascript key
);
</script>
```

Once you have installed a Parse SDK, the first step to start using it is to initialize the SDK with your app's credentials so it can have access to your APIs. You can find your app's credentials in the [Security & Keys](https://parse-dashboard.back4app.com/apps/{{app.id}}/settings/keys) section of your app's Parse Dashboard. For your commodity, you can also find them below and in the right panel code snippets.

### Application ID

`{{app.appId}}`

### Client key

`{{app.clientKey}}`

### JavaScript key

`{{app.javascriptKey}}`

### .NET key

`{{app.dotnetKey}}`

### REST API key

`{{app.restKey}}`

### Webhook key

`{{app.webhookKey}}`

### File key

`{{app.fileKey}}`

### Master key

`{{app.masterKey}}`

# Objects API

> Example Object:

```json
{
  "objectId": "4BwpMWdCnm",
  "myCustomKey1Name": "myCustomKey1Value",
  "myCustomKey2Name": "myCustomKey2Value",
  "createdAt": "2018-11-06T00:52:01.520Z",
  "updatedAt": "2018-11-06T00:52:04.713Z"
}
```

> The special keys objectId, createdAt and updatedAt are default and always automatically created by the platform.

Performing CRUD (create, read, update and delete) operations through Back4App - Parse Server Hosting - is really simple and can be done using the Objects API. Each object consists of a set of key-value pairs that are transacted through the API as a JSON document. The keys must be alphanumeric strings and the values must be anything that can be JSON-encoded. The objects are organized in classes so you can distinguish different sorts of data.

The data that represents an object is schemaless which means that you don't need to specify ahead of time a new custom class schema. You just need to send the data and Parse will learn from it. But if for any reason you prefer to specify your class schema before sending the data, you can do that using the `Create a class` button in the [Database Browser](https://parse-dashboard.back4app.com/apps/{{app.id}}/browser) of your app's Parse Dashboard.

For each new custom class that you create in your app's schema (either through API or just sending the data), a new endpoint is generated at the address below through which you can perform your CRUD operations:

`{{app.apiURL}}/classes/MyCustomClassName`

In addition, a new section in this documentation is automatically generated for each new custom class that you create through which you can learn how to perform the CRUD operations specifically to one class' objects.

Please note that the User class' objects is a special case and has its own API whose documentation you can find [here](#users-api) and endpoint is the one that you can find below:

`{{app.apiURL}}/users`

## Creating Objects

<blockquote class="lang-specific shell"><p>
Example Request:
</p></blockquote>

```shell
curl -X POST \
-H "X-Parse-Application-Id: {{app.appId}}" \
-H "X-Parse-REST-API-Key: {{app.restKey}}" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"myCustomKey1Name":"myCustomKey1Value","myCustomKey2Name":"myCustomKey2Value"}' \
{{app.apiURL}}/classes/MyCustomClassName
```

<blockquote class="lang-specific shell"><p>
Example Response:
</p></blockquote>

```shell
{
  "objectId": "4BwpMWdCnm",
  "createdAt": "2018-11-06T00:52:01.520Z"
}
```

<blockquote class="lang-specific javascript"><p>
Code:
</p></blockquote>

```javascript
const MyCustomClass = Parse.Object.extend('MyCustomClassName');
const myNewObject = new MyCustomClass();

myNewObject.set('myCustomKey1Name', 'myCustomKey1Value');
myNewObject.set('myCustomKey2Name', 'myCustomKey2Value');

myNewObject.save().then(
  (result) => {
    console.log(result);
  },
  (error) => {
    console.error(error);
  }
);
```

<blockquote class="lang-specific javascript"><p>
Example Output:
</p></blockquote>

```javascript
ParseObjectSubclass {
  className: 'MyCustomClassName',
  _objCount: 0,
  id: '4BwpMWdCnm'
}
```

To create a new object, you'll need to send a `POST` request to its class endpoint with your app's credentials in the headers and the object's data in the body. You can include as many key-value pairs as you want. This task can be easily accomplished just by calling the appropriated method of your preferred Parse SDK. Please check how to do it in the right panel of this documentation.
